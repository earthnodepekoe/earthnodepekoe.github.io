MWC Barcelona is the epicenter of global connectivity. Every year, for four days, the industry’s most influential leaders gather to discuss and define the technologies that will shape the future of telecommunications.  

For World Mobile, MWC has always been an opportunity to stand among giants and demonstrate that decentralization is not just an idea - it is the path forward.

From March 3 to March 6, we were back in Barcelona for MWC25, meeting directly with partners, collaborators, and leaders across telecom and Web3. Our focus this year? Strengthening partnerships that aligned with our mission, closing deals with fellow web3 and telco leaders, and demonstrating that we are not just contributing to blockchain-powered telco - we are the leaders.

A Defining Year for Decentralized Networks
MWC has always been a showcase for the latest advancements in telecommunications. This year, the event emphasized AI-driven network optimization, eSIM evolution, and hardware innovations, all shaping the next era of telecommunications.

“MWC25 had all the energy and engagement of last year, but with a sharper focus on tangible advancements in telecom infrastructure. We saw a lot more emphasis on hardware - radios, RAN technology, and consumer products. We realized that eSIM adoption is accelerating and witnessed a clear push towards next-generation telecom solutions.” - Micky Watkins, CEO, World Mobile
There was also renewed conversation around the enduring importance of terrestrial hardware. While satellite connectivity is expanding and plays an essential role in bridging hard-to-reach regions, many industry voices reaffirmed that ground-based infrastructure will continue to be the backbone of global connectivity for the foreseeable future. For us, it’s not a question of either-or. It’s about integration. We see satellite and terrestrial systems working in tandem - complementing each other to unlock coverage and deliver resilient, distributed access in times when it is needed most.

One thing was clear: the telecom industry is at a crossroads. Legacy networks are struggling to keep up with global demand, particularly in underserved regions where infrastructure costs are prohibitive. The centralized model, with its dependence on costly licensing fees and opaque control structures, is failing. World Mobile offers a different vision - one where individuals and businesses have ownership over the networks they rely on.  

And our vision resonated.

Micky Watkins on World Mobile’s Industry Impact
From early morning meetings to late-night strategy sessions, the World Mobile team had a packed schedule speaking with regulators, major operators, and technology partners looking to explore decentralized connectivity.  

The recognition from GSMA was especially significant. “We discovered that GSMA considers us the leading voice in blockchain-powered telecom,” Micky explained. “Every major entity that wanted to discuss blockchain and telecom was directed to us. That kind of recognition is extremely encouraging - a signal that the industry is ready to move in our direction.”

A key theme across discussions was the practical application of World Mobile’s model. “Operators and regulators were interested in how we deploy infrastructure at a lower cost while maintaining security and privacy,” he noted. “The distributed nature of our EarthNode model eliminates many of the inefficiencies of traditional networks. It’s a model that enables both profitability and accessibility, and that’s something that drew a lot of eyeballs.”

MWC25 was also about action. Several agreements were signed during the event, setting the stage for accelerated adoption of decentralized connectivity solutions. “We left Barcelona with concrete commitments,” Micky confirmed. “These are real partnerships that will drive expansion in the coming months.”

Christian Rees on World Mobile’s Strategy at MWC25
For Nevada Regional Manager Christian Rees, MWC25 marked a shift in how World Mobile engages with the industry. “Our reputation preceded us,” he explained. “The focus was not on shouting from the rooftops – it was on solidifying long-term relationships and ensuring that the right companies were aligned with our vision.”

The event facilitated discussions on a broad spectrum of innovation, particularly the role of AI in network management. “AI is more than a telecom buzzword - it’s a necessary evolution of blockchain-powered telecom if used in the right ways,” Christian said. “Companies are actively integrating AI to optimize RAN networks, improve connectivity management, and enhance system resilience. The ability to create self-optimizing networks is becoming critical.”

These advancements align closely with World Mobile’s mission. A decentralized network must be intelligent, self-maintaining, and capable of adapting to diverse conditions. For World Mobile, AI has been instrumental for optimizing network management - as demonstrated in our work with Fraunhofer in Zanzibar. “With AI-driven solutions, even someone without a technical background can deploy and maintain connectivity infrastructure,” Christian said. “This removes one of the biggest barriers to scalable, decentralized network adoption.”

The Road Ahead
MWC25 was a launchpad for what comes next. The conversations, agreements, and collaborations initiated in Barcelona will directly impact our expansion strategy for the rest of the year and beyond.
